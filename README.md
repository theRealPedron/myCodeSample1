this is a sample of Board.java that I created for an algorithms class.
it was created in order to implement an 8-puzzle solver, using an A*search 
algorithm.

I have also included a JUnit test class with it that I used to provide regression tests.

This is only a piece of the total project. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. thanks!
